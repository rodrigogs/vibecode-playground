  "subtitle": "A useless project built entirely by AIs to see how far they can go",
  "introduction": "Brain-rot Factory is a web application where users chat with AI-generated Italian 'brain-rot' meme characters, powered by other AIs - creating a meta-linguistic loop that's simultaneously absurd and technically sophisticated. The choice of Italian brain-rot characters was deliberate: these viral memes are themselves AI-generated content, making our platform a perfect recursive experiment where AI talks to AI-generated characters through AI systems. Among these characters, Tralalero-tralala stands out as a personal favorite, particularly memorable for his distinctive habit of wearing three shoes simultaneously - a delightfully absurd detail that perfectly captures the essence of AI-generated creativity. This project serves as a real, complete, and publicly auditable laboratory for 100% AI-driven development.",
  "overview": {
    "title": "Project Overview",
    "description": "What started as an experiment to test AI coding capabilities became a comprehensive platform demonstrating the limits and potential of human-AI collaboration. The goal isn't practical utility - it's to prove how far AI agents can go when building real software with proper architecture, testing, and deployment. Rodrigo Gomes da Silva (Brazil, 1991) acted as prompt engineer and curator, writing zero lines of TypeScript code - only guiding, reverting hallucinations, cleaning phantom files, and making architectural decisions. As of July 22, 2025, the project stands as a testament to what's possible: 407 tests running with 74% coverage, Next.js 15 build successful, zero security vulnerabilities, 249 translation keys across 6 languages (100% complete), and a public demo live on Vercel. What makes this achievement particularly remarkable is that every single line of code, every architectural decision, and every technical implementation emerged from conversational exchanges between human intent and artificial intelligence capabilities."

The model autonomously created complete visual design that exceeded all aesthetic expectations and established a new paradigm of trust in AI collaboration.
