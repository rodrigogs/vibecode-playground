## Key Translation Instructions for Other Languages
When updating PT, IT, ID, JA, ZH versions:

### Content to Add:
- **Brain-rot explanation**: "The choice of Italian brain-rot characters was deliberate: these viral memes are themselves AI-generated content"
- **Tralalero-tralala mention**: "Among these characters, Tralalero-tralala stands out as a personal favorite, particularly memorable for his distinctive habit of wearing three shoes simultaneously"
- **Meta-linguistic loop**: "creating a perfect recursive experiment where AI talks to AI-generated characters through AI systems"

### Sections to Merge:
- Combine overview + currentStats into flowing narrative
- Merge creativeProcess into aiJourney as designJourney subsection
- Combine philosophy + team into single section
- Merge future + acknowledgments + openSource
- Integrate aiPackageSpotlight content into architecture.monorepo description
- Consolidate testing.professionalComparison into testing description

### Remove Excessive Formatting:
- Remove emoji bullet points
- Convert bullet lists to flowing paragraphs where possible
- Reduce sub-headers and nested structures
- Focus on narrative flow over structured documentation

The goal is a more journalistic, story-driven approach while maintaining all technical information.
