/**
 * Checkpoint savers for persisting LangGraph state
 *
 * This module provides a persistent checkpoint implementation that integrates
 * with the @repo/cache package for flexible storage backends.
 *
 * The implementation follows LangChain/LangGraph patterns and properly implements
 * the BaseCheckpointSaver interface with thread-based organization, proper
 * serialization, and full compliance with checkpoint persistence standards.
